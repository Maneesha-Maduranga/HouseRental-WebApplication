# House Rental Web App
### Welcome to our MERN-based house rental web app! This app allows users to browse available rental listings, search for specific rental properties, and book reservations for their desired dates.

## Technologies Used
### This app was built using the following technologies:

- MongoDB: for the database that stores rental listings and reservation data
- Express: for the server-side framework that handles HTTP requests and responses
- React: for the user interface and client-side rendering
- Node.js: for the backend environment that runs the server-side code
